Good Life Dataset
========================================================

This work is based on a previous study performed by

Oâ€™Neill, D.W., Fanning, A.L., Lamb, W.F., and Steinberger, J.K. (2018).
A good life for all within planetary boundaries.
Nature Sustainability 1, 88-95. doi: 10.1038/s41893-018-0021-4

Concept
========================================================

This study has been done from a set of data organised such as it is usable for the DOUGHNUT MODEL.
This Doughnut economic theory (Kate Raworth) is encompassing in the same model criteria which are related to :
  * the biophysical boundary (CO2 Emissions, Material Footprint, Blue Water...)
  * The social Threshold (Nutrition, Education, Income, Access to Energy...)

Data Explanation
========================================================

The data has been collected with care by the University of Leeds team.
The data has been standardized such as:
  * Planet Boundary limits have been overshoot if the value is > 1
  * Social acceptable threshold has not been passed if the value is < 1

Data Product Description
========================================================

The Data product is designed to allow the user to compare 2 countries of the dataset.

The Planet Boundaries Values and Social Threshold can be refined within a tickbox panel.

The colors have been also conditioned to the value (red is bad, green if ok...).
